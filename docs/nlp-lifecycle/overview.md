# NLP Lifecycle Overview

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) Lifecycle documentation. This comprehensive guide covers the complete journey from problem definition to model deployment for NLP projects.

## NLP Project Lifecycle Steps

### 1. [Problem Definition](./problem-definition.md)

Define your NLP problem, objectives, success metrics, and constraints. Understand the business context and technical requirements.

### 2. [Data Collection](./data-collection.md)

Gather text data from various sources including web scraping, APIs, databases, and public datasets. Learn about data acquisition strategies for NLP projects.

### 3. [Text Exploration & Analysis](./text-exploration-analysis.md)

Analyze your text data to understand patterns, distributions, and characteristics. Perform exploratory data analysis specific to text data.

### 4. [Text Preprocessing & Preparation](./text-preprocessing-preparation.md)

Clean and prepare your text data through tokenization, normalization, and various preprocessing techniques essential for NLP.

### 5. [Feature Engineering](./feature-engineering.md)

Transform text into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF, word embeddings, and advanced representation learning methods.

### 6. [Model Training](./model-training.md)

Train NLP models using traditional machine learning approaches and modern deep learning architectures like transformers.

### 7. [Model Evaluation](./model-evaluation.md)

Evaluate your NLP models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques specific to natural language processing tasks.

### 8. [Model Deployment](./model-deployment.md)

Deploy your NLP models to production environments with proper scaling, monitoring, and maintenance considerations.

## Common NLP Tasks

This lifecycle applies to various NLP tasks including:

- **Text Classification**: Sentiment analysis, spam detection, topic classification
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracting entities from text
- **Text Summarization**: Abstractive and extractive summarization
- **Machine Translation**: Translating between languages
- **Question Answering**: Building QA systems
- **Text Generation**: Creating natural language content
- **Information Extraction**: Structured data from unstructured text

## Key Technologies & Frameworks

- **Libraries**: NLTK, spaCy, Gensim, scikit-learn
- **Deep Learning**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers (Hugging Face)
- **Pre-trained Models**: BERT, GPT, T5, RoBERTa
- **Deployment**: FastAPI, Flask, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Monitoring**: MLflow, Weights & Biases, TensorBoard

## Best Practices

- Start with simple baselines before complex models
- Use pre-trained models when possible
- Pay attention to data quality and preprocessing
- Consider computational constraints and latency requirements
- Implement proper evaluation and monitoring
