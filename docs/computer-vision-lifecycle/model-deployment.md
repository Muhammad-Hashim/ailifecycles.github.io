# Model Deployment

## Overview

Model deployment involves taking your trained computer vision model from development to production environment.

## Deployment Strategies

### Cloud Deployment
- AWS SageMaker, Google AI Platform
- Serverless functions
- Container orchestration

### Edge Deployment
- Mobile devices (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX)
- IoT devices
- Embedded systems

## Production Considerations

### Performance Optimization
- Model quantization
- Pruning and compression
- Hardware acceleration

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Performance tracking
- Model drift detection
- Continuous integration
