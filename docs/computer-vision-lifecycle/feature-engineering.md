# Feature Engineering for Computer Vision

## Overview

Feature engineering in computer vision involves transforming raw image data into meaningful representations that improve model performance.

## Feature Extraction Techniques

### Traditional Features
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)  
- HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
- LBP (Local Binary Patterns)

### Deep Learning Features
- Pre-trained CNN features
- Transfer learning representations
- Attention mechanisms

## Next Steps
