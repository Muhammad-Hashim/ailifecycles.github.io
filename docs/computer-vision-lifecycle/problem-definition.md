# Problem Definition in Computer Vision

## Overview

Defining the computer vision problem is the critical first step that shapes your entire project. This phase involves understanding the business requirements, technical constraints, and success metrics.

## Key Steps

### 1. Problem Identification

**Business Understanding:**
- What business problem are you solving?
- Who are the stakeholders and end users?
- What is the expected ROI?

**Technical Problem Definition:**
- Classification, Detection, Segmentation, or Generation?
- Real-time or batch processing requirements?
- Input/output specifications

### 2. Success Metrics Definition

**Performance Metrics:**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Mean Average Precision (mAP) for detection
- Intersection over Union (IoU) for segmentation
- Inference speed requirements

**Business Metrics:**
- Cost reduction
- Time savings
- Error reduction
- User satisfaction

### 3. Constraints and Requirements

**Technical Constraints:**
- Hardware limitations (GPU, memory, storage)
- Latency requirements
- Throughput needs
- Model size constraints

**Data Constraints:**
- Available data volume
- Data quality
- Privacy and security requirements
- Labeling resources

## Common Computer Vision Problems

### Image Classification
- **Problem**: Assign a single label to an entire image
- **Examples**: Medical diagnosis, quality control, content moderation
- **Metrics**: Accuracy, Top-k accuracy

### Object Detection
- **Problem**: Locate and classify multiple objects in images
- **Examples**: Autonomous driving, surveillance, retail analytics
- **Metrics**: mAP, precision-recall curves

### Semantic Segmentation
- **Problem**: Classify every pixel in an image
- **Examples**: Medical imaging, satellite imagery analysis
- **Metrics**: IoU, Dice coefficient

### Instance Segmentation
- **Problem**: Detect and segment individual object instances
- **Examples**: Cell counting, robotics, augmented reality
- **Metrics**: mAP with IoU thresholds

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with the minimum viable solution
2. **Define Clear Success Criteria**: Set measurable goals upfront
3. **Consider Edge Cases**: Think about failure scenarios
4. **Plan for Scalability**: Design for future growth
5. **Involve Domain Experts**: Get input from subject matter experts
