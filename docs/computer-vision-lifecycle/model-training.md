# Model Training

## Overview

Model training is the core phase where your computer vision model learns from the prepared dataset.

## Training Process

### Model Architecture Selection
- CNN architectures (ResNet, EfficientNet, Vision Transformer)
- Task-specific models (YOLO, R-CNN, U-Net)

### Training Configuration
- Loss functions
- Optimizers  
- Learning rate scheduling
- Batch size and epochs

## Next Steps

- [Model Evaluation](./model-evaluation.md)
- [Model Deployment](./model-deployment.md)
