# Computer Vision Lifecycle Overview

Welcome to the Computer Vision Lifecycle documentation. This comprehensive guide covers the complete journey from problem definition to model deployment for computer vision projects.

## Computer Vision Project Lifecycle Steps

### 1. [Problem Definition](./problem-definition.md)

Define your computer vision problem, objectives, success metrics, and constraints. Understand the visual task and technical requirements.

### 2. [Data Collection](./data-collection.md)

Gather image/video data from various sources including cameras, datasets, web scraping, and synthetic data generation.

### 3. [Image Data Exploration & Analysis](./data-exploration-analysis.md)

Analyze your visual data to understand distributions, quality issues, and dataset characteristics specific to computer vision.

### 4. [Data Preprocessing & Augmentation](./data-preprocessing-augmentation.md)

Clean and prepare your visual data through resizing, normalization, and data augmentation techniques.

### 5. [Feature Engineering](./feature-engineering.md)

Extract visual features using traditional methods and modern deep learning approaches for computer vision tasks.

### 6. [Model Training](./model-training.md)

Train computer vision models using CNNs, Vision Transformers, and other state-of-the-art architectures.

### 7. [Model Evaluation](./model-evaluation.md)

Evaluate your computer vision models using appropriate metrics and validation techniques for visual tasks.

### 8. [Model Deployment](./model-deployment.md)

Deploy your computer vision models for real-time or batch processing with proper optimization and monitoring.
