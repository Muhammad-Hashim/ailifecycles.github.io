# Generative AI Lifecycle Overview

Welcome to the Generative AI Lifecycle documentation. This comprehensive guide covers the complete journey from problem definition to model deployment for generative AI projects including LLMs, diffusion models, and other generative systems.

## Generative AI Project Lifecycle Steps

### 1. [Problem Definition](./problem-definition.md)

Define your generative AI problem, use case, success metrics, and constraints. Understand the generation task and quality requirements.

### 2. [Data Collection & Preparation](./data-collection-preparation.md)

Gather and prepare training data for generative models including text corpora, images, or multimodal datasets.

### 3. [Data Analysis & Quality Assessment](./data-analysis-quality.md)

Analyze your training data for quality, diversity, bias, and other characteristics crucial for generative models.

### 4. [Model Architecture Selection](./model-architecture-selection.md)

Choose appropriate generative architectures: transformers for text, diffusion models for images, or multimodal approaches.

### 5. [Training & Fine-tuning](./training-fine-tuning.md)

Train generative models from scratch or fine-tune pre-trained models using techniques like RLHF, LoRA, and prompt engineering.

### 6. [Evaluation & Safety Assessment](./evaluation-safety-assessment.md)

Evaluate generative models for quality, coherence, safety, and potential harmful outputs or biases.

### 7. [Optimization & Inference](./optimization-inference.md)

Optimize models for deployment using techniques like quantization, distillation, and efficient inference methods.

### 8. [Deployment & Monitoring](./deployment-monitoring.md)

Deploy generative AI systems with proper safety measures, monitoring, and continuous improvement processes.
